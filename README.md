# Cole Kiekow CRUD Project

# Author

I'm Cole Kiekow, a high school student in the class Computer Science Principals.

This is my final project where I had to make a website with the criteria that it had to have each of these:

CRUD - 
C - create
R - read
U - update
D - delete

I have about a year's experience with HTML and CSS but PHP and SQL are new to me and I only have a month or two's experience in them.

# Development

To create this website I used cloud 9 to help with the development of the program and testing using minimal help from others and online resources.

# Use and Purpose

This website is intended to make yourself more accessable to your friends on Steam and vice versa, making it easier to play games with friends online.

The use is fairly simple and self explanitory, you can just enter your information where requested and search others in the the search box.

When you use the search boxes, anyone with the first or last name you entered comes up in the results, making sure you find who you're looking for as well as allowing you to
only enter one of the requested values such as only the first name or only the last name.

When entering your Steam name be sure not to upload any personal information that you don't want others to see because although you can update and delete your info, 
before you do anyone can see what you upload.

As mentioned before there is an option to update your information in case you ever change your Steam name as well as an option to delete your information if you decide you
don't want others to be able to see it anymore.

There is a page for account creation, but it's a bit glitchy for now and doesn't serve much of a purpose so I wouldn't recommend using it until I can make some further improvements.

Thank You and I hope you enjoy!
